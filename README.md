# 3. Small Heist
  - When I first started this project, my main goal was to make a 3D racing game. 
  - As I progressed in the development, I got interested in chasing AI.
  - The chasing AI is not perfect, but I accomplished my goal and now I know what Unity Ai is capable of.
  - The map was made by me, using an Asset Pack from Unity Store.

My main goal is to learn game development. Itâ€™s really interesting to me that you can achieve in a video game with coding. 
I made a lot of tutorials as well from Youtube, Unity and Udemy to learn more about how coding works in a videogame.
